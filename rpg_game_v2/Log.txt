2018/12/21:
	to do:
	--inventory:
		implement a for loop so that array values(1/0) can be checked so that entire array can be called at once intead of 
			statically calling each item name.
		implement private array into a temp public array so that ArrayLength can be used to get arrays length
			array length doesnt seem to work on objects of arrays
		implement more options for inventory menu screen --> use item (self/other), throw away, back)
	completed:
		none. ;)
